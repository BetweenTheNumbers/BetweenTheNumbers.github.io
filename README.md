# Twitter NLP Sentiment Analysis
Gathering tweets and performing sentiment analysis on players in the NHL.

For both Data Visualizations, the goal was to create a demo that's lightweight, fast, and simple. In a production environment, all the Twitter data should be stored and retrieved from a database. Data manipulation should be done client-side if possible to limit reliance on subsequent server-side requests.
